## An Example
A function is a block of code that only runs when it is called. Functions have to be declared first, and then they can be called or run. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result. In Python, a function is declared as follows: 
```
def name ():
    code
```
Each function needs an unique name and has to have the keyword def as a prefix.


## Arguments
Arguments can have multiple input variables. These arguments provide the necessary data for the function to perform its task. The arrangement and order of input values are determined by the developer who creates the function. For example, consider a function named add_numbers that takes two numbers as input to calculate their sum.
