##Why should you learn Python?

Despite its simplicity, Python can be used for complex software projects and allows them to grow together with their tasks since Python is what is called “scalable”.

Due to its expressive, minimalist syntax, applications can be implemented with few lines of code and a relatively low chance for programming errors.

To ensure this simplicity and clarity, Python gets by with very few keywords and uses indentations as structuring elements.

You will learn about these keywords and the structure in the upcoming units. Now let’s focus on why Python is relevant for us in cybersecurity and what makes it a good starting point for getting into programming (and what you will have to look out for when using Python since it also comes with a few disadvantages).
