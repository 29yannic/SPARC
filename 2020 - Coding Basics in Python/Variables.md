## Declaration, Definition, and Initialization

### Declaration
Declaration is the process of announcing the existence of a variable. However, in Python, variable declaration is not required. Variables are automatically created when they are assigned a value.

### Definition
Definition involves assigning an initial value to a variable. It gives the variable a memory location and storage space to hold the assigned value. In Python, variable definition usually happens simultaneously with assignment. When a value is assigned to a variable for the first time, the variable is automatically defined.

### Initialization
Initialization refers to the process of assigning an initial value to a declared or defined variable

### Lifetime of a Variable
Variables only exist during the runtime of a program.
Once executed, the varaibles are no longer stored in the memory.
